In the 0.5 version there is a change in the way the serial port is configured in icommand.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the releases up to 0.4 the serial port was configured by setting the environment variable
NXTCOMM, e.g. NXTCOMM=COM4. Starting from release 0.5 the configuration is done by using a
properies file 'icommand.properties'.

Contents of file 'icommand.properties':

# Set the value of the nxtcomm property to the value of ->your<- serial port,
# e.g. COM4 (on Windows), /dev/tty.NXT_1 (on Mac OSX), /dev/rfcomm0 (on Linux)
nxtcomm=COM4

1. In  the file 'icommand.properties' set the value of 'nxtcomm' property to the value of your serial port.
2. Put the file 'icommand.properties' into your home directory, or your working directory.
3. To check the location and contents of the file, execute the command: java -jar icommand.jar

C:\>java -jar icommand.jar
Looking for 'icommand.properties' in working directory: C:\
Looking for 'icommand.properties' in home directory: C:\Documents and Settings\peter
Your serial port is: COM4

The reason for this change is the deprecation of the use of environment variables by Java.
